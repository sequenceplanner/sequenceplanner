# Sequence Planner
In many modern automation solutions, traditional off-line and manual programming is being replaced by online algorithms that dynamically perform tasks based on the state of the environment. Complexities of such systems are pushed even further with collaboration among robots and humans, where intelligent machines and learning algorithms are replacing more traditional automation solutions.

Sequence Planner (SP) is a control system written in rust for automation control based on ROS2 that tries to handle the increased complexity of these new systems using formal models and online planning algorithms to coordinate the actions of robots and other devices.
